+Definitions
+
+"Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to (a) a company
+or organization (each an "Entity") accessing the Programs, if use of the
+Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b) an individual accessing the
+Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on behalf of an Entity.
+"Program(s)" refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle pursuant to the
+following terms and any updates, error corrections, and/or Program Documentation
+provided by Oracle. "Program Documentation" refers to Program user manuals and
+Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation may be

+with the Programs. If specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice
+files, such technology will be licensed to You under Separate Terms. Your rights
+to use Separately Licensed Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in
+any way by the terms herein. For clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a
+notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Technology shall
+be deemed part of the Programs licensed to You under the terms of this license.
+
+Source Code for Open Source Software
+
+For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under
+an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for
+that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from
+https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. If
+the source code for such software was not provided to You with the binary, You
+can also receive a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting a
+written request pursuant to the instructions in the "Written Offer for Source
+Code" section of the latter website.

+
+The following license terms apply to those Programs that are not provided to You
+under Separate Terms.
+

+
+Oracle grants to You, as a recipient of this Program, subject to the conditions
+stated herein, a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license to:

+(a) internally use the unmodified Programs for the purposes of developing,
+testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications, and running the
+Program for Your own personal use or internal business operations; and
+
+(b) redistribute the unmodified Program and Program Documentation, under the
+terms of this License, provided that You do not charge Your licensees any fees
+associated with such distribution or use of the Program, including, without
+limitation, fees for products that include or are bundled with a copy of the
+Program or for services that involve the use of the distributed Program.
+
+You may make copies of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary for
+exercising the license rights granted herein and for backup purposes. You are
+granted the right to use the Programs to provide third party training in the use
+of the Programs and associated Separately Licensed Technology only if there is
+express authorization of such use by Oracle on the Program's download page or in

+  data);
+
+- You do not cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or decompilation
+  of the Programs (except as allowed by law) by You nor allow an associated
+  party to do so.
+
+For clarity, any source code that may be included in the distribution with the
+Programs is provided solely for reference purposes and may not be modified,
+unless such source code is under Separate Terms permitting modification.
+
+Ownership
+
+Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to
+the Programs.

+DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
+ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
+LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY

+#           JAXP Configuration File
+#
+# jaxp.properties (this file) is the default configuration file for JAXP, the API
+# defined in the java.xml module. It is in java.util.Properties format and typically
+# located in the {java.home}/conf directory. It may contain key/value pairs for
+# specifying the implementation classes of JAXP factories and/or properties
+# that have corresponding system properties.
+#
+# A user-specified configuration file can be set up using the system property
+# java.xml.config.file to override any or all of the entries in jaxp.properties.
+# The following statement provides myConfigurationFile as a custom configuration
+# file:

+# ---- JAXP Default Configuration ----

+# The JAXP default configuration (jaxp.properties) contains entries for the

+# JAXP Lookup Mechanism:
+#
+# The JAXP configuration file ranks 2nd to the System Property in the precedent
+# order of the JAXP Lookup Mechanism. When the System Property is not specified,

+# class. If found, the class specified will be used as the factory implementation
+# class.
+#
+# The format of an entry is key=value where the key is the fully qualified name
+# of the factory and value that of the implementation class. The following entry
+# set a DocumentBuilderFactory implementation class:
+#
+# javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl
+#
+#
+# Java SE and JDK Implementation Specific Properties:
+#
+# The JAXP configuration file ranks above the default settings in the Property
+# Precedence in that its entries will override the default values of the corresponding
+# properties.
+#
+# All properties that have System Properties defined in Java SE or supported
+# by the JDK Implementation can be placed in the configuration file to override
+# the default property values. The format is:
+#     system-property-name=value
+#
+# For example, the FILES property in CatalogFeatures has an associated system
+# property called javax.xml.catalog.files. An entry for the FILES property in the
+# configuration file would therefore use javax.xml.catalog.files as the key, that
+# is:
+#     javax.xml.catalog.files=strict
+#
+#
+# Extension Functions:
+#
+# This property determines whether XSLT and XPath extension functions are allowed.
+# The value type is boolean and the default value is true (allowing
+# extension functions). The following entry would override the default value and
+# disallow extension functions:
+#
+# jdk.xml.enableExtensionFunctions=false
+#
+#
+# Overriding the default parser:
+#
+# This property allows using a third party implementation to override the default
+# parser provided by the JDK. The value type is boolean and the default value is
+# false, disallowing overriding the default parser. The setting below reflects
+# the default property setting:
+#
+jdk.xml.overrideDefaultParser=false
+#
+#
+# External Access Properties:
+#
+# The External Access Properties are defined in javax.xml.XMLConstants. Their
+# system properties are javax.xml.accessExternalDTD, javax.xml.accessExternalSchema,
+# and javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet. The values are a list of protocols separated
+# by comma, plus empty string ("") to represent no protocol allowed and the key
+# word "all" for all access. The default is "all", allowing all external resources
+# to be fetched. The followings are example of external access settings:
+#
+# allow local (file) DTDs to be retrieved
+# javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=file
+#
+# allow local (file) and remote (http) external schemas
+# javax.xml.accessExternalSchema=file, http
+#
+# reject any external stylesheets
+# javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet=""
+#
+# allow all external stylesheets
+# javax.xml.accessExternalStylesheet="all"
+#
+#
+# Catalog Properties:
+#
+# The Catalog API defines four features: FILES, PREFER, DEFER and RESOLVE.
+# Except PREFER, all other properties can be placed in the configuration file
+# using the system properties defined for them.
+#
+# FILES: A semicolon-delimited list of URIs to locate the catalog files. The URIs
+# must be absolute and have a URL protocol handler for the URI scheme. The following
+# is an example of setting up a catalog file:
+#
+# javax.xml.catalog.files = file:///users/auser/catalog/catalog.xml
+#
+# DEFER: Indicates that the alternative catalogs including those specified in
+# delegate entries or nextCatalog are not read until they are needed. The value
+# is a boolean and the default value is true.
+#
+# javax.xml.catalog.defer=true
+#
+# RESOLVE: Determines the action if there is no matching entry found after all of
+# the specified catalogs are exhausted. The values are key words: strict, continue,
+# and ignore. The default is strict. The following setting reflects the default
+# setting.
+#
+# javax.xml.catalog.resolve=strict
+#
+#
+# useCatalog:
+# This property instructs XML processors to use XML Catalogs to resolve entity
+# references. The value is a boolean and the default value is true.
+#
+# javax.xml.useCatalog=true
+#
+#
+# Implementation Specific Properties - Limits
+#
+# Limits have a value type Integer. The values must be positive integers. Zero
+# means no limit.
+#
+# Limits the number of entity expansions. The default value is 64000
+# jdk.xml.entityExpansionLimit=64000
+#
+# Limits the total size of all entities that include general and parameter entities.
+# The size is calculated as an aggregation of all entities. The default value is 5x10^7.
+# jdk.xml.totalEntitySizeLimit=5E7
+#
+# Limits the maximum size of any general entities. The default value is 0.
+# jdk.xml.maxGeneralEntitySizeLimit=0
+#
+# Limits the maximum size of any parameter entities, including the result of
+# nesting multiple parameter entities. The default value is 10^6.
+# jdk.xml.maxParameterEntitySizeLimit=1E6
+#
+# Limits the total number of nodes in all entity references. The default value is 3x10^6.
+# jdk.xml.entityReplacementLimit=3E6
+#
+# Limits the number of attributes an element can have. The default value is 10000.
+# jdk.xml.elementAttributeLimit=10000
+#
+# Limits the number of content model nodes that may be created when building a
+# grammar for a W3C XML Schema that contains maxOccurs attributes with values
+# other than "unbounded". The default value is 5000.
+# jdk.xml.maxOccurLimit=5000
+#
+# Limits the maximum element depth. The default value is 0.
+# jdk.xml.maxElementDepth=0
+#
+# Limits the maximum size of XML names, including element name, attribute name
+# and namespace prefix and URI. The default value is 1000.
+jdk.xml.maxXMLNameLimit=1000

+# XPath Limits
+#
+# Limits the number of groups an XPath expression can contain. The default value is 10.

+#     Default Access Control File for Remote JMX(TM) Monitoring
+######################################################################
+#
+# Access control file for Remote JMX API access to monitoring.
+# This file defines the allowed access for different roles.  The
+# password file (jmxremote.password by default) defines the roles and their
+# passwords.  To be functional, a role must have an entry in
+# both the password and the access files.
+#
+# The default location of this file is $JRE/conf/management/jmxremote.access
+# You can specify an alternate location by specifying a property in
+# the management config file $JRE/conf/management/management.properties
+# (See that file for details)
+#
+# The file format for password and access files is syntactically the same
+# as the Properties file format.  The syntax is described in the Javadoc
+# for java.util.Properties.load.
+# A typical access file has multiple lines, where each line is blank,
+# a comment (like this one), or an access control entry.
+#
+# An access control entry consists of a role name, and an
+# associated access level.  The role name is any string that does not
+# itself contain spaces or tabs.  It corresponds to an entry in the
+# password file (jmxremote.password).  The access level is one of the
+# following:
+#       "readonly" grants access to read attributes of MBeans.
+#                   For monitoring, this means that a remote client in this
+#                   role can read measurements but cannot perform any action
+#                   that changes the environment of the running program.
+#       "readwrite" grants access to read and write attributes of MBeans,
+#                   to invoke operations on them, and optionally
+#                   to create or remove them. This access should be granted
+#                   only to trusted clients, since they can potentially
+#                   interfere with the smooth operation of a running program.
+#
+# The "readwrite" access level can optionally be followed by the "create" and/or
+# "unregister" keywords.  The "unregister" keyword grants access to unregister
+# (delete) MBeans.  The "create" keyword grants access to create MBeans of a
+# particular class or of any class matching a particular pattern.  Access
+# should only be granted to create MBeans of known and trusted classes.
+#
+# For example, the following entry would grant readwrite access
+# to "controlRole", as well as access to create MBeans of the class
+# javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor and to unregister any MBean:
+#  controlRole readwrite \
+#              create javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitorMBean \
+#              unregister
+# or equivalently:
+#  controlRole readwrite unregister create javax.management.monitor.CounterMBean
+#
+# The following entry would grant readwrite access as well as access to create
+# MBeans of any class in the packages javax.management.monitor and
+# javax.management.timer:
+#  controlRole readwrite \
+#              create javax.management.monitor.*,javax.management.timer.* \
+#              unregister
+#
+# The \ character is defined in the Properties file syntax to allow continuation
+# lines as shown here.  A * in a class pattern matches a sequence of characters
+# other than dot (.), so javax.management.monitor.* matches
+# javax.management.monitor.CounterMonitor but not
+# javax.management.monitor.foo.Bar.
+#
+# A given role should have at most one entry in this file.  If a role
+# has no entry, it has no access.
+# If multiple entries are found for the same role name, then the last
+# access entry is used.
+#
+#
+# Default access control entries:
+# o The "monitorRole" role has readonly access.
+# o The "controlRole" role has readwrite access and can create the standard
+#   Timer and Monitor MBeans defined by the JMX API.
+
+monitorRole   readonly
+controlRole   readwrite \
+              create javax.management.monitor.*,javax.management.timer.* \
+              unregister

+#      in order to control which particular SSL/TLS protocol versions are
+#      enabled for use by accepted connections. If this property is not

+#      protocol versions that are enabled by default.
+#
+
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.need.client.auth=true|false
+#      Default for this property is false. (Case for true/false ignored)
+#      If this property is specified as true in conjunction with the previous

+
+#
+# ################ RMI User authentication ################
+#
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true|false
+#      Default for this property is true. (Case for true/false ignored)
+#      If this property is specified as false then no authentication is

+#
+
+# For RMI monitoring without any checking use the following line
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
+
+#
+# ################ RMI Login configuration ###################
+#
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.login.config=<config-name>
+#      Specifies the name of a JAAS login configuration entry to use when
+#      authenticating users of RMI monitoring.
+#
+#      Setting this property is optional - the default login configuration
+#      specifies a file-based authentication that uses the password file.
+#
+#      When using this property to override the default login configuration
+#      then the named configuration entry must be in a file that gets loaded
+#      by JAAS. In addition, the login module(s) specified in the configuration
+#      should use the name and/or password callbacks to acquire the user's
+#      credentials. See the NameCallback and PasswordCallback classes in the
+#      javax.security.auth.callback package for more details.
+#
+#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate" is set to
+#      false, then this property and the password & access files are ignored.
+#
+
+# For a non-default login configuration use the following line
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.login.config=<config-name>
+
+#
+# ################ RMI Password file location ##################
+#
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=filepath
+#      Specifies location for password file
+#      This is optional - default location is
+#      $JRE/conf/management/jmxremote.password
+#
+#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate" is set to
+#      false, then this property and the password & access files are ignored.
+#      Otherwise the password file must exist and be in the valid format.
+#      If the password file is empty or non-existent then no access is allowed.
+#
+
+# For a non-default password file location use the following line
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=filepath
+
+#
+# ################# Hash passwords in password file ##############
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.password.toHashes = true|false
+#      Default for this property is true.
+#      Specifies if passwords in the password file should be hashed or not.
+#      If this property is true, and if the password file is writable, and if the
+#      system security policy allows writing into the password file,
+#      all the clear passwords in the password file will be replaced by
+#      their SHA3-512 hash when the file is read by the server
+#
+
+#
+# ################ RMI Access file location #####################
+#
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=filepath
+#      Specifies location for access  file
+#      This is optional - default location is
+#      $JRE/conf/management/jmxremote.access
+#
+#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate" is set to
+#      false, then this property and the password & access files are ignored.
+#      Otherwise, the access file must exist and be in the valid format.
+#      If the access file is empty or non-existent then no access is allowed.
+#
+
+# For a non-default password file location use the following line
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=filepath
+#
+
+# ################ Management agent listen interface #########################
+#
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.host=<host-or-interface-name>
+#      Specifies the local interface on which the JMX RMI agent will bind.
+#      This is useful when running on machines which have several
+#      interfaces defined. It makes it possible to listen to a specific
+#      subnet accessible through that interface.
+#
+#      The format of the value for that property is any string accepted
+#      by java.net.InetAddress.getByName(String).
+#
+
+# ################ Filter for ObjectInputStream #############################
+# com.sun.management.jmxremote.serial.filter.pattern=<filter-string>
+#   A filter, if configured, is used by java.io.ObjectInputStream during
+#   deserialization of parameters sent to the JMX default agent to validate the
+#   contents of the stream.
+#   A filter is configured as a sequence of patterns, each pattern is either
+#   matched against the name of a class in the stream or defines a limit.
+#   Patterns are separated by ";" (semicolon).
+#   Whitespace is significant and is considered part of the pattern.
+#
+#   If a pattern includes a "=", it sets a limit.
+#   If a limit appears more than once the last value is used.
+#   Limits are checked before classes regardless of the order in the sequence of patterns.
+#   If any of the limits are exceeded, the filter status is REJECTED.
+#
+#       maxdepth=value - the maximum depth of a graph
+#       maxrefs=value  - the maximum number of internal references
+#       maxbytes=value - the maximum number of bytes in the input stream
+#       maxarray=value - the maximum array length allowed
+#
+#   Other patterns, from left to right, match the class or package name as
+#   returned from Class.getName.
+#   If the class is an array type, the class or package to be matched is the element type.
+#   Arrays of any number of dimensions are treated the same as the element type.
+#   For example, a pattern of "!example.Foo", rejects creation of any instance or
+#   array of example.Foo.
+#
+#   If the pattern starts with "!", the status is REJECTED if the remaining pattern
+#       is matched; otherwise the status is ALLOWED if the pattern matches.
+#   If the pattern contains "/", the non-empty prefix up to the "/" is the module name;
+#       if the module name matches the module name of the class then
+#       the remaining pattern is matched with the class name.
+#   If there is no "/", the module name is not compared.
+#   If the pattern ends with ".**" it matches any class in the package and all subpackages.
+#   If the pattern ends with ".*" it matches any class in the package.
+#   If the pattern ends with "*", it matches any class with the pattern as a prefix.
+#   If the pattern is equal to the class name, it matches.
+#   Otherwise, the status is UNDECIDED.
+#
+#   Ending with !* ensures we reject classes which are otherwise unmatched.

+
+# Authentication Scheme restrictions for HTTP and HTTPS.
+#
+# In some environments certain authentication schemes may be undesirable
+# when proxying HTTP or HTTPS.  For example, "Basic" results in effectively the
+# cleartext transmission of the user's password over the physical network.
+# This section describes the mechanism for disabling authentication schemes
+# based on the scheme name. Disabled schemes will be treated as if they are not
+# supported by the implementation.
+#
+# The 'jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes' property lists the authentication
+# schemes that will be disabled when tunneling HTTPS over a proxy, HTTP CONNECT.
+# The 'jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes' property lists the authentication
+# schemes that will be disabled when proxying HTTP.
+#
+# In both cases the property is a comma-separated list of, case-insensitive,
+# authentication scheme names, as defined by their relevant RFCs. An
+# implementation may, but is not required to, support common schemes whose names
+# include: 'Basic', 'Digest', 'NTLM', 'Kerberos', 'Negotiate'.  A scheme that
+# is not known, or not supported, by the implementation is ignored.
+#
+# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation. It
+# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
+#
+#jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes=
+jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=Basic
+
+#
+# Allow restricted HTTP request headers
+#
+# By default, the following request headers are not allowed to be set by user code
+# in HttpRequests: "connection", "content-length", "expect", "host" and "upgrade".
+# The 'jdk.httpclient.allowRestrictedHeaders' property allows one or more of these
+# headers to be specified as a comma separated list to override the default restriction.
+# The names are case-insensitive and white-space is ignored (removed before processing
+# the list). Note, this capability is mostly intended for testing and isn't expected
+# to be used in real deployments. Protocol errors or other undefined behavior is likely
+# to occur when using them. The property is not set by default.
+# Note also, that there may be other headers that are restricted from being set
+# depending on the context. This includes the "Authorization" header when the
+# relevant HttpClient has an authenticator set. These restrictions cannot be
+# overridden by this property.
+#
+# jdk.httpclient.allowRestrictedHeaders=host
+#
+#
+# Transparent NTLM HTTP authentication mode on Windows. Transparent authentication
+# can be used for the NTLM scheme, where the security credentials based on the
+# currently logged in user's name and password can be obtained directly from the
+# operating system, without prompting the user. This property has three possible
+# values which regulate the behavior as shown below. Other unrecognized values
+# are handled the same as 'disabled'. Note, that NTLM is not considered to be a
+# strongly secure authentication scheme and care should be taken before enabling
+# this mechanism.

+# jdk.http.maxHeaderSize=393216
+#
+# This is the maximum header field section size that a client is prepared to accept.
+# This is computed as the sum of the size of the uncompressed header name, plus
+# the size of the uncompressed header value, plus an overhead of 32 bytes for
+# each field section line. If a peer sends a field section that exceeds this
+# size a {@link java.net.ProtocolException ProtocolException} will be raised.

+#
+# Whenever a KDC is detected as available, it is removed from the secondary

+# Kerberos cross-realm referrals (RFC 6806)

+#
+# When a client issues an AS or a TGS request, the "canonicalize" option

+# Algorithm restrictions for certification path (CertPath) processing
+#
+# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
+# for certification path building and validation.  For example, "MD2" is
+# generally no longer considered to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section
+# describes the mechanism for disabling algorithms based on algorithm name
+# and/or key length.  This includes algorithms used in certificates, as well
+# as revocation information such as CRLs and signed OCSP Responses.
+# The syntax of the disabled algorithm string is described as follows:
+#   DisabledAlgorithms:
+#       " DisabledAlgorithm { , DisabledAlgorithm } "
+#
+#   DisabledAlgorithm:
+#       AlgorithmName [Constraint] { '&' Constraint } | IncludeProperty
+#
+#   AlgorithmName:
+#       (see below)
+#
+#   Constraint:
+#       KeySizeConstraint | CAConstraint | DenyAfterConstraint |
+#       UsageConstraint
+#
+#   KeySizeConstraint:
+#       keySize Operator KeyLength
+#
+#   Operator:
+#       <= | < | == | != | >= | >
+#
+#   KeyLength:
+#       Integer value of the algorithm's key length in bits
+#
+#   CAConstraint:
+#       jdkCA
+#
+#   DenyAfterConstraint:
+#       denyAfter YYYY-MM-DD
+#
+#   UsageConstraint:
+#       usage [TLSServer] [TLSClient] [SignedJAR]
+#
+#   IncludeProperty:
+#       include <security property>
+#
+# The "AlgorithmName" is the standard algorithm name of the disabled
+# algorithm. See the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification
+# for information about Standard Algorithm Names.  Matching is
+# performed using a case-insensitive sub-element matching rule.  (For
+# example, in "SHA1withECDSA" the sub-elements are "SHA1" for hashing and
+# "ECDSA" for signatures.)  If the assertion "AlgorithmName" is a
+# sub-element of the certificate algorithm name, the algorithm will be
+# rejected during certification path building and validation.  For example,
+# the assertion algorithm name "DSA" will disable all certificate algorithms
+# that rely on DSA, such as NONEwithDSA, SHA1withDSA.  However, the assertion
+# will not disable algorithms related to "ECDSA".
+#
+# The "IncludeProperty" allows a implementation-defined security property that
+# can be included in the disabledAlgorithms properties.  These properties are
+# to help manage common actions easier across multiple disabledAlgorithm
+# properties.
+# There is one defined security property:  jdk.disabled.namedCurves
+# See the property for more specific details.
+#
+#
+# A "Constraint" defines restrictions on the keys and/or certificates for
+# a specified AlgorithmName:
+#
+#   KeySizeConstraint:
+#     keySize Operator KeyLength
+#       The constraint requires a key of a valid size range if the
+#       "AlgorithmName" is of a key algorithm.  The "KeyLength" indicates
+#       the key size specified in number of bits.  For example,
+#       "RSA keySize <= 1024" indicates that any RSA key with key size less
+#       than or equal to 1024 bits should be disabled, and
+#       "RSA keySize < 1024, RSA keySize > 2048" indicates that any RSA key
+#       with key size less than 1024 or greater than 2048 should be disabled.
+#       This constraint is only used on algorithms that have a key size.
+#
+#   CAConstraint:
+#     jdkCA
+#       This constraint prohibits the specified algorithm only if the
+#       algorithm is used in a certificate chain that terminates at a marked
+#       trust anchor in the lib/security/cacerts keystore.  If the jdkCA
+#       constraint is not set, then all chains using the specified algorithm
+#       are restricted.  jdkCA may only be used once in a DisabledAlgorithm
+#       expression.
+#       Example:  To apply this constraint to SHA-1 certificates, include
+#       the following:  "SHA1 jdkCA"
+#
+#   DenyAfterConstraint:
+#     denyAfter YYYY-MM-DD
+#       This constraint prohibits a certificate with the specified algorithm
+#       from being used after the date regardless of the certificate's
+#       validity.  JAR files that are signed and timestamped before the
+#       constraint date with certificates containing the disabled algorithm
+#       will not be restricted.  The date is processed in the UTC timezone.
+#       This constraint can only be used once in a DisabledAlgorithm
+#       expression.
+#       Example:  To deny usage of RSA 2048 bit certificates after Feb 3 2020,
+#       use the following:  "RSA keySize == 2048 & denyAfter 2020-02-03"
+#
+#   UsageConstraint:
+#     usage [TLSServer] [TLSClient] [SignedJAR]
+#       This constraint prohibits the specified algorithm for
+#       a specified usage.  This should be used when disabling an algorithm
+#       for all usages is not practical. 'TLSServer' restricts the algorithm
+#       in TLS server certificate chains when server authentication is
+#       performed. 'TLSClient' restricts the algorithm in TLS client
+#       certificate chains when client authentication is performed.
+#       'SignedJAR' constrains use of certificates in signed jar files.
+#       The usage type follows the keyword and more than one usage type can
+#       be specified with a whitespace delimiter.
+#       Example:  "SHA1 usage TLSServer TLSClient"
+#
+# When an algorithm must satisfy more than one constraint, it must be
+# delimited by an ampersand '&'.  For example, to restrict certificates in a
+# chain that terminate at a distribution provided trust anchor and contain
+# RSA keys that are less than or equal to 1024 bits, add the following
+# constraint:  "RSA keySize <= 1024 & jdkCA".
+#
+# All DisabledAlgorithms expressions are processed in the order defined in the
+# property.  This requires lower keysize constraints to be specified
+# before larger keysize constraints of the same algorithm.  For example:
+# "RSA keySize < 1024 & jdkCA, RSA keySize < 2048".
+#
+# Note: The algorithm restrictions do not apply to trust anchors or
+# self-signed certificates.
+#
+# Note: This property is currently used by Oracle's PKIX implementation. It
+# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
+#
+# Example:
+#   jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048

+#
+# For example, the cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA uses RSA as the

+# mode) as the cipher (encryption) algorithm, and SHA-1 as the message digest
+# algorithm for HMAC.
+#
+# The LegacyAlgorithm can be one of the following standard algorithm names:

+#     2. JSSE key exchange algorithm name, e.g., RSA
+#     3. JSSE cipher (encryption) algorithm name, e.g., AES_128_CBC
+#     4. JSSE message digest algorithm name, e.g., SHA
+#
+# See SSL/TLS specifications and the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names
+# Specification for information about the algorithm names.

+# Note: If a legacy algorithm is also restricted through the

+# Deserialization JVM-wide filter
+#
+# A filter, if configured, is used by the filter factory to provide the filter used by
+# java.io.ObjectInputStream during deserialization to check the contents of the stream.
+# A filter is configured as a sequence of patterns, each pattern is either
+# matched against the name of a class in the stream or defines a limit.
+# Patterns are separated by ";" (semicolon).
+# Whitespace is significant and is considered part of the pattern.
+#
+# If the system property jdk.serialFilter is also specified, it supersedes
+# the security property value defined here.
+#
+# If a pattern includes a "=", it sets a limit.
+# If a limit appears more than once the last value is used.
+# Limits are checked before classes regardless of the order in the
+# sequence of patterns.
+# If any of the limits are exceeded, the filter status is REJECTED.
+#
+#   maxdepth=value - the maximum depth of a graph
+#   maxrefs=value  - the maximum number of internal references
+#   maxbytes=value - the maximum number of bytes in the input stream
+#   maxarray=value - the maximum array length allowed
+#
+# Other patterns, from left to right, match the class or package name as
+# returned from Class.getName.
+# If the class is an array type, the class or package to be matched is the
+# element type.
+# Arrays of any number of dimensions are treated the same as the element type.
+# For example, a pattern of "!example.Foo", rejects creation of any instance or
+# array of example.Foo.
+#
+# If the pattern starts with "!", the status is REJECTED if the remaining
+# pattern is matched; otherwise the status is ALLOWED if the pattern matches.
+# If the pattern contains "/", the non-empty prefix up to the "/" is the
+# module name;
+#   if the module name matches the module name of the class then
+#   the remaining pattern is matched with the class name.
+#   If there is no "/", the module name is not compared.
+# If the pattern ends with ".**" it matches any class in the package and all
+# subpackages.
+# If the pattern ends with ".*" it matches any class in the package.
+# If the pattern ends with "*", it matches any class with the pattern as a

+#
+# The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter.

+# to increase limits.
+# If the limits (maxdepth, maxrefs, or maxbytes) are exceeded, the object is rejected.
+#
+# Each non-array type is allowed or rejected if it matches one of the patterns,

+#
+# Array construction of any component type, including subarrays and arrays of

+# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.

+# properties can be overridden by a KeyStore API that specifies its own
+# algorithms and parameters.
+#
+# If an existing PKCS12 keystore is loaded and then stored, the algorithm and
+# parameter used to generate the existing Mac will be reused. If the existing
+# keystore does not have a Mac, no Mac will be created while storing. If there
+# is at least one certificate in the existing keystore, the algorithm and
+# parameters used to encrypt the last certificate in the existing keystore will
+# be reused to encrypt all certificates while storing. If the last certificate
+# in the existing keystore is not encrypted, all certificates will be stored
+# unencrypted. If there is no certificate in the existing keystore, any newly
+# added certificate will be encrypted (or stored unencrypted if algorithm
+# value is "NONE") using the "keystore.pkcs12.certProtectionAlgorithm" and
+# "keystore.pkcs12.certPbeIterationCount" values defined here. Existing private
+# and secret key(s) are not changed. Newly set private and secret key(s) will
+# be encrypted using the "keystore.pkcs12.keyProtectionAlgorithm" and
+# "keystore.pkcs12.keyPbeIterationCount" values defined here.
+#
+# In order to apply new algorithms and parameters to all entries in an
+# existing keystore, one can create a new keystore and add entries in the
+# existing keystore into the new keystore. This can be achieved by calling the
+# "keytool -importkeystore" command.
+#
+# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the
+# security property value defined here.
+#
+# If the property is set to an illegal value, an iteration count that is not
+# a positive integer, or an unknown algorithm name, an exception will be thrown
+# when the property is used. If the property is not set or empty, a default
+# value will be used.
+#
+# Some PKCS12 tools and libraries may not support algorithms based on PBES2
+# and AES. To create a PKCS12 keystore which they can load, set the system
+# property "keystore.pkcs12.legacy" which overrides the values of the properties
+# defined below with legacy algorithms. Setting this system property (which can
+# only be enabled and has no value) is equivalent to

+            Java(TM) Cryptography Extension Policy Files
+    for the Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment
+
+                               README
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Import and export control rules on cryptographic software vary from
+country to country.  The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) architecture
+allows flexible cryptographic key strength to be configured via the
+jurisdiction policy files which are referenced by the "crypto.policy"
+security property in the <java-home>/conf/security/java.security file.
+
+By default, Java provides two different sets of cryptographic policy
+files:
+
+    unlimited:  These policy files contain no restrictions on cryptographic
+                strengths or algorithms
+
+    limited:    These policy files contain more restricted cryptographic
+                strengths
+
+These files reside in <java-home>/conf/security/policy in the "unlimited"
+or "limited" subdirectories respectively.
+
+Each subdirectory contains a complete policy configuration,
+and subdirectories can be added/edited/removed to reflect your
+import or export control product requirements.
+
+Within a subdirectory, the effective policy is the combined minimum
+permissions of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename
+pattern "default_*.policy".  At least one grant is required.  For example:
+
+    limited   =  Export (all) + Import (limited)  =  Limited
+    unlimited =  Export (all) + Import (all)      =  Unlimited
+
+The effective exemption policy is the combined minimum permissions
+of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename pattern
+"exempt_*.policy".  Exemption grants are optional.  For example:
+
+    limited   =  grants exemption permissions, by which the
+                 effective policy can be circumvented.
+                 e.g.  KeyRecovery/KeyEscrow/KeyWeakening.
+
+Please see the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) documentation for
+additional information on these files and formats.
+
+YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT YOUR EXPORT/IMPORT CONTROL COUNSEL OR ATTORNEY
+TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS.
+
+Please note that the JCE for Java SE, including the JCE framework,
+cryptographic policy files, and standard JCE providers provided with
+the Java SE, have been reviewed and approved for export as mass market
+encryption item by the US Bureau of Industry and Security.

+ * AWT native interface.
+ *
+ * The AWT native interface allows a native C or C++ application a means
+ * by which to access native structures in AWT.  This is to facilitate moving
+ * legacy C and C++ applications to Java and to target the needs of the
+ * developers who need to do their own native rendering to canvases
+ * for performance or other reasons.
+ *
+ * Conversely it also provides mechanisms for an application which already
+ * has a native window to provide that to AWT for AWT rendering.
+ *
+ * Since every platform may be different in its native data structures
+ * and APIs for windowing systems the application must necessarily
+ * provided per-platform source and compile and deliver per-platform
+ * native code  to use this API.
+ *
+ * These interfaces are not part of the Java SE specification and
+ * a VM is not required to implement this API. However it is strongly
+ * recommended that all implementations which support headful AWT
+ * also support these interfaces.

+ * This header file defines the data structures sent by the VM
+ * through the JVMTI CompiledMethodLoad callback function via the
+ * "void * compile_info" parameter. The memory pointed to by the
+ * compile_info parameter may not be referenced after returning from
+ * the CompiledMethodLoad callback. These are VM implementation
+ * specific data structures that may evolve in future releases. A
+ * JVMTI agent should interpret a non-NULL compile_info as a pointer
+ * to a region of memory containing a list of records. In a typical
+ * usage scenario, a JVMTI agent would cast each record to a
+ * jvmtiCompiledMethodLoadRecordHeader, a struct that represents
+ * arbitrary information. This struct contains a kind field to indicate
+ * the kind of information being passed, and a pointer to the next
+ * record. If the kind field indicates inlining information, then the
+ * agent would cast the record to a jvmtiCompiledMethodLoadInlineRecord.
+ * This record contains an array of PCStackInfo structs, which indicate
+ * for every pc address what are the methods on the invocation stack.
+ * The "methods" and "bcis" fields in each PCStackInfo struct specify a
+ * 1-1 mapping between these inlined methods and their bytecode indices.
+ * This can be used to derive the proper source lines of the inlined
+ * methods.

+Your use of this Program is governed by the No-Fee Terms and Conditions set
+forth below, unless you have received this Program (alone or as part of another
+Oracle product) under an Oracle license agreement (including but not limited to
+the Oracle Master Agreement), in which case your use of this Program is governed
+solely by such license agreement with Oracle.
+
+Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions (NFTC)
+
+Definitions
+
+"Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to (a) a company
+or organization (each an "Entity") accessing the Programs, if use of the
+Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b) an individual accessing the
+Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on behalf of an Entity.
+"Program(s)" refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle pursuant to the
+following terms and any updates, error corrections, and/or Program Documentation
+provided by Oracle. "Program Documentation" refers to Program user manuals and
+Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation may be
+delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed from
+www.oracle.com/documentation. "Separate Terms" refers to separate license terms
+that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files and
+that apply to Separately Licensed Technology. "Separately Licensed Technology"
+refers to Oracle or third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms
+and not under the terms of this license.
+
+Separately Licensed Technology
+
+Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation, readmes or
+notice files in connection with Oracle or third party technology provided as or
+with the Programs. If specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice
+files, such technology will be licensed to You under Separate Terms. Your rights
+to use Separately Licensed Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in
+any way by the terms herein. For clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a
+notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Technology shall
+be deemed part of the Programs licensed to You under the terms of this license.
+
+Source Code for Open Source Software
+
+For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under
+an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for
+that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from
+https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. If
+the source code for such software was not provided to You with the binary, You
+can also receive a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting a
+written request pursuant to the instructions in the "Written Offer for Source
+Code" section of the latter website.
+
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The following license terms apply to those Programs that are not provided to You
+under Separate Terms.
+
+License Rights and Restrictions
+
+Oracle grants to You, as a recipient of this Program, subject to the conditions
+stated herein, a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license to:
+
+(a) internally use the unmodified Programs for the purposes of developing,
+testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications, and running the
+Program for Your own personal use or internal business operations; and
+
+(b) redistribute the unmodified Program and Program Documentation, under the
+terms of this License, provided that You do not charge Your licensees any fees
+associated with such distribution or use of the Program, including, without
+limitation, fees for products that include or are bundled with a copy of the
+Program or for services that involve the use of the distributed Program.
+
+You may make copies of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary for
+exercising the license rights granted herein and for backup purposes. You are
+granted the right to use the Programs to provide third party training in the use
+of the Programs and associated Separately Licensed Technology only if there is
+express authorization of such use by Oracle on the Program's download page or in
+the Program Documentation.
+
+Your license is contingent on compliance with the following conditions:
+
+- You do not remove markings or notices of either Oracle's or a licensor's
+  proprietary rights from the Programs or Program Documentation;
+
+- You comply with all U.S. and applicable export control and economic sanctions
+  laws and regulations that govern Your use of the Programs (including technical
+  data);
+
+- You do not cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or decompilation
+  of the Programs (except as allowed by law) by You nor allow an associated
+  party to do so.
+
+For clarity, any source code that may be included in the distribution with the
+Programs is provided solely for reference purposes and may not be modified,
+unless such source code is under Separate Terms permitting modification.
+
+Ownership
+
+Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to
+the Programs.
+
+Information Collection
+
+The Programs' installation and/or auto-update processes, if any, may transmit a
+limited amount of data to Oracle or its service provider about those processes
+to help Oracle understand and optimize them. Oracle does not associate the data
+with personally identifiable information. Refer to Oracle's Privacy Policy at
+www.oracle.com/privacy.
+
+Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability
+
+THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ORACLE FURTHER
+DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
+NONINFRINGEMENT.
+
+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ORACLE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
+DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
+ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
+LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

+ #
+ #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

+5. Time Zone Database
+
+  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
+Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
+is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
+Database section 7.
+
+ # 7.  Database Ownership
+ #
+ #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
+ #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
+ #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
+ #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
+ #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
+ #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
+ #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
+ #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
+ #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
+ #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
+ #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
+ #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
+ #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+-------------------
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+--------------
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.

+*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

+*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *

+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal

+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+----------------
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+---------------------------
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

+```
+
+#### CC0 1.0 Universal
+```
+Statement of Purpose
+
+The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
+exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
+subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
+authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
+
+Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
+purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
+works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
+claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
+and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
+purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
+contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
+further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
+reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
+efforts of others.
+
+For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
+of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
+Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
+and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
+and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
+effect of CC0 on those rights.
+
+1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
+protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
+Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
+to, the following:
+
+  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
+  and translate a Work;
+
+  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
+
+  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
+  depicted in a Work;
+
+  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
+  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
+
+  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
+  a Work;
+
+  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
+  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
+  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
+  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
+
+  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
+  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
+
+2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
+applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
+unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
+and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
+known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
+action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
+duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
+extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
+copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
+commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
+the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
+detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
+shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
+any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
+by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
+
+3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
+judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
+shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
+is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
+non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
+unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
+the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
+provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
+in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
+purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
+promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
+of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
+License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
+applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
+invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
+affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
+and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
+
+4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
+
+  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
+  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
+
+  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
+  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
+  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
+  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
+  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
+  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
+
+  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
+  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
+  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
+  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
+  or other rights required for any use of the Work.
+
+  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
+  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
+  CC0 or use of the Work.

+
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
+  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
+  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
+  FreeType Project.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
+  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
+  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
+  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
+
+  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
+  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
+  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
+  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
+
+    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
+      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
+
+    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
+      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
+
+    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
+      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
+      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
+      FreeType code. (`credits')
+
+  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
+  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
+  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
+  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
+
+
+  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
+  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
+  encourage you to use the following text:
+
+   """
+    Portions of this software are copyright  <year> The FreeType
+    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
+   """
+
+  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
+  actually use.
+
+
+Legal Terms
+===========
+
+0. Definitions
+--------------
+
+  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
+  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
+  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
+  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
+  beta or final release.
+
+  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
+  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
+  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
+  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
+  engine'.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
+  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
+  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
+  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
+  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
+  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
+
+  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
+  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
+  specified below.
+
+1. No Warranty
+--------------
+
+  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
+  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
+  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
+  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
+  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
+  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
+
+2. Redistribution
+-----------------
+
+  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
+  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
+  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
+  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
+  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
+  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
+  herein, subject to the following conditions:
+
+    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
+      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
+      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
+      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
+      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
+      files.
+
+    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
+      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
+      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
+      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
+      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
+
+  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
+  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
+  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
+  to us.
+
+3. Advertising
+--------------
+
+  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
+  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
+  purposes without specific prior written permission.
+
+  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
+  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
+  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
+  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
+
+  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
+  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
+  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
+  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
+  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
+  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
+  of this license.
+
+4. Contacts
+-----------
+
+  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
+
+    o freetype@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
+      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
+      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
+      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
+
+    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
+      specific licenses, porting, etc.
+
+  Our home page can be found at

+All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
+
+Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute
+this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee,
+subject to these conditions:
+
+(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
+then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
+notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
+files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
+
+(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
+must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the
+Independent JPEG Group".
+
+(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
+full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
+NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
+
+These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
+not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
+acknowledge us.
+
+Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
+in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived
+from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG
+Group's software".
+
+We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
+of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
+assumed by the product vendor.
+
+It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
+by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
+cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
+reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
+JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
+over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
+implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are
+no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
+
+The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
+To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
+has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
+produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
+the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
+standard GIF decoders.
+
+We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
+the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a
+Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

+   exercising permissions granted by this License.

+   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+   source, and configuration files.
+
+   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

+   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
